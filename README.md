# CS-Architecture

This homework will guide you through how to set up the server end for further development by using a client-server architecture.

Normally, a back end includes a web server, a database server, and an interpreter for the PHP language. In this class, we recommend Apache web server and MySQL database server. Although you can install and configure these components individually, that can be tedious and error prone. As a result, we recommend using the **XAMPP** package to simplify the installation of Apache, MySQL and PHP.

- Here are the tasks you will need to perform in JavaScript or PHP: \*
  _Create a global array to store all employees as you add them. I would name it 'employees', but that is really up to you._
  _Create an employeeId variable and store a randomly generated 8 digit employee id number. Make sure the id number is unique._
  _Add an employeeId property to your employee object and set its value to your employeeId variable._
  _Make the employee object as a JSON object and send it to the back end as a JSON object._
  _Add each newly created employee to your employees array (check duplicate before adding)._
  _Just so you can debug things easier, use console.log to output your employees array to the console after creating a new employee._
  _Display the employee in the output HTML._
  _Add one last line to your message that will display the total number of employees that have been added to your array._
  _At the bottom of the form add a browser icon detected by your code to show which browser the user is currently using._
  _Once you are done with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and/or PHP, upload your code to a GitHub repository. Make sure the repository is public so that I can review your code._
  _Take the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or PHP from your completed work in your GitHub repository and upload them to you’re a public accessible website._
  _Submit the URL of your GitHub repository where your working code can be found._
  _Submit the URL of your publicly accessible website_.
